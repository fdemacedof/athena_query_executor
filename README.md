# AthenaQueryExecutor

AthenaQueryExecutor is a Python class that allows you to execute queries on Amazon Athena and retrieve the results as a Pandas DataFrame. This class utilizes the Boto3 library to interact with the Athena service.

## Features

- Executes queries on Amazon Athena.
- Retrieves the query results as a Pandas DataFrame.
- Handles query execution errors and provides appropriate error messages.

## Prerequisites

Before using the AthenaQueryExecutor class, make sure you have the following prerequisites:

- AWS account credentials with the necessary permissions to access Athena.
- Python 3.x installed on your system.
- Required Python libraries: botocore, boto3, time, pandas.

## Usage

Follow the steps below to use the AthenaQueryExecutor class:

1. Import the necessary libraries:
```python
import botocore.session
import boto3
import time
import pandas as pd
```

2. Create an instance of the AthenaQueryExecutor class:
```python
query_executor = AthenaQueryExecutor()
```

3. Execute a query:
```python
query = "SELECT * FROM your_table"
database = "your_database"
df = query_executor.execute_query(query, database)
```
- Replace "your_table" with the name of the table you want to query.
- Replace "your_database" with the name of the Athena database containing the table.

4. Access the query results:
```python
print(df.head())
```
- This will print the first few rows of the DataFrame containing the query results.

## Customization

You can customize the behavior of the AthenaQueryExecutor class by modifying the following attributes:

- `region`: Set the desired AWS region for your Athena queries.
- `OutputLocation`: Set the S3 bucket and path where the query results should be stored.

```python
self.region = 'us-east-1'
self.athena_client = self.session.client('athena')
self.athena_client.start_query_execution(
    QueryString=query,
    QueryExecutionContext={'Database': database},
    ResultConfiguration={'OutputLocation': 's3://your-bucket/your-path'}
)
```
- Replace "us-east-1" with the desired AWS region code.
- Replace "your-bucket/your-path" with the S3 bucket and path where you want to store the query results.

## Error Handling

The AthenaQueryExecutor class provides error handling for query execution failures. If a query fails or is cancelled, an appropriate error message will be printed.

```python
if status == 'SUCCEEDED':
    # Process query results
else:
    error_message = response['QueryExecution']['Status']['StateChangeReason']
    print("Query execution failed or was cancelled. Error message: ", error_message)
```

## Conclusion

The AthenaQueryExecutor class simplifies the process of executing queries on Amazon Athena and retrieving the results as a Pandas DataFrame. You can easily integrate this class into your data analysis workflows and leverage the power of Athena for querying large datasets stored in Amazon S3.
